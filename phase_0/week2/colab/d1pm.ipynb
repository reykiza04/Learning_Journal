        "\n",
        "In this sections, you’ll develop a very small database for a social media application. The database will consist of four tables:\n",
        "\n",
        "- users\n",
        "- posts\n",
        "- comments\n",
        "- likes\n",

        "\n",
        "Both users and posts will have a one-to-many relationship since one user can like many posts. Similarly, one user can post many comments, and one post can also have multiple comments. So, both users and posts will also have one-to-many relationships with the comments table. This also applies to the likes table, so both users and posts will have a one-to-many relationship with the likes table.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a database, there is an entity which uniquely identifies a row in a table, namely **Primary Key**. Primary key in a relational table prevents duplicate rows in that table. In order to connect a table to another/others, we need an entity that connect each table, which is **Foreign Key**.\n",

        "## Basic SQL\n",
        "SQL (Standard Query Language) is a standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases. Contrasting Python, SQL is not a case-sensitive language so both of lower and upper case are the same meaning. However, usually to differentiate the command to others, we used UPPERCASE to write the commands. SQL commands list diagram is shown below:\n",

Otherwise, a new database is created at the specified location, and a connection is established.\n",
