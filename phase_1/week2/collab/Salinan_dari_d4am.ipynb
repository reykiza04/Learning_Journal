        "What is Data Wrangling ?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data wrangling or data munging, is the process of **transforming** and **mapping** data from one \"raw\" data-source data-form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We can simply say that the data wrangling process is a **method of data cleaning and data preparation** by converting it from one form to a more understandable form mainly for preliminary data analytics.\n",

        "  * Data Enrichment\n",
        "  * etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. This might mean modifying all of the values in a given column in a certain way, or merging multiple columns together. \n",
        "\n",
        "5. The necessity for data wrangling is often a biproduct of poorly collected or presented data. Data that is entered manually by humans is typically fraught with errors; data collected from websites is often optimized to be displayed on websites, not to be sorted and aggregated.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. You can think Data Wrangling is like Preprocessing in Machine Learning. But, we are using SQL to cleaning the data rather than using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. You can use DDL and DML syntax that youâ€™ve already learn in previous phase."
